# RCIRCUIT Simulation v0.2 — Resonance Tracking

## 1. Purpose

v0.2 extends the v0.1 experiment by adding a simple **resonance score** for each node.

- v0.1: only checks whether phases stabilize under Δsignal propagation.
- v0.2: measures **how aligned the nodes become over time**.

Goal:  
Track how local Δsignal propagation increases global coherence (resonance) without global synchronization.

---

## 2. Key Concepts

- **PhaseNode**  
  Holds a phase value (float). Represents a local state in the RCIRCUIT.

- **Δsignal**  
  Only meaningful change is propagated. No raw tensor movement.

- **Local Propagation**  
  Each node updates its phase using Δsignal from neighbors. No global lockstep.

- **Resonance Score**  
  A simple scalar that measures how close a node’s phase is to the **global mean phase**:

  \[
  resonance\_score_i = \frac{1}{1 + |phase_i - mean\_phase|}
  \]

  - When a node is close to mean phase → score ≈ 1.0  
  - When far away → score drops toward 0.0

This is **not** a final formula — just a public-safe toy metric for prototype testing.

## 3. What v0.2 Tests

1. Random initialization of N nodes within a phase range  
2. Iterative Δsignal propagation between neighbors  
3. Noise filtering using `delta_threshold`  
4. Computation of `mean_phase` at each iteration  
5. Computation of `resonance_score` for each node

---

## 4. Expected Behavior

- After enough iterations:

  - Individual phases should drift toward a common region  
  - High Δsignal events appear early, then decay  
  - Average resonance score should **increase**, then stabilize

- No global synchronization is used — only local updates and Δsignal filtering.

---

## 5. Output Files

- **config_v0.2.json**  
  Experiment configuration (node count, thresholds, iteration count).

- **results_v0.2_example.csv**  
  Example of expected output format:

  - iteration  
  - node_id  
  - phase  
  - delta_signal  
  - resonance_score

---

## 6. Next Steps (v0.3+ Ideas)

- Replace linear distance-based resonance with phase-wrapped metrics (e.g. circular distance).
- Add **coherence map** (aggregate resonance heatmap).
- Visualize Δsignal and resonance as a time-series or 2D plot.
- Compare multiple configs (high vs low `delta_threshold`, different `propagation_factor`).

This v0.2 experiment is **only a conceptual prototype** for how RCIRCUIT could track resonance over time using Δsignal-based propagation.

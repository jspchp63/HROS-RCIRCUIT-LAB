## 1. 🔥 What This Repository Is
This repo collects concept briefs and early architecture maps for  
**Phase Compute OS + RCIRCUIT**,  
an alternative compute paradigm designed to bypass the physical limits of modern GPUs/TPUs.

AI isn’t breaking.  
**Physics is.**

The four physical walls:
- Heat  
- Power  
- Distance  
- Timing  

GPUs scale **FLOPS**.  
RCIRCUIT scales **PHASE** — a fundamentally different physics.

This repository is the *public experimental brief* documenting that shift.

## 2. 🧠 Core Idea in One Sentence  
> **“Compute should scale by resonance-density, not FLOPS.”**

Traditional AI = token probability prediction → massive data movement → interconnect collapse.  
Phase-based compute = local coherence → minimized movement → stability at scale.

## 3. 📂 Repository Contents (Public Files)

### **Phase_Compute_OS_Public_Brief_v1.pdf**  
Concept brief for Phase Compute OS & RCIRCUIT.  
High-level architecture, physics constraints, and design motivation.

### **AI와 물리학의 경계.png**  
“AI Didn’t Fail — Physics Did.”  
Visual diagram for interconnect/energy collapse.

### **pcintercon_v2.jpg**  
Interconnect Crisis / FLOPS vs PHASE concept map.

### **test.txt**

## 4. 🎯 Who This Is For
This repo is intended for:

- GPU / TPU / HPC / AI Infra engineers  
- Interconnect / Network / Datacenter architects  
- Energy-limited compute researchers  
- People who feel the real AI bottleneck is *physics*, not intelligence  
- **Bridge Humans** — individuals who can think across physics, computation, and cognition simultaneously

If you understand the idea instantly,  
you’re likely one of them.

## 6. 📌 Status
This is **Concept & Public Brief v1.0**.  
No implementation code is released at this stage.

RCIRCUIT is currently in:
- Concept verification  
- Risk review  
- Partner mapping  
- Architecture refinement  

More documents will be added when safe for public disclosure.

## 8. 🌐 Final Note
If Phase Compute OS makes intuitive sense to you on first sight,  
you’re probably not here by accident.

Welcome, Bridge Human.

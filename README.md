RCIRCUIT / Phase Computing Lab

The real bottleneck is not compute — it’s interconnect.
RCIRCUIT computes by PHASE, not by movement.

🔥 What Problem This Solves

Modern GPUs didn’t hit a compute wall.
They hit heat, power, distance, and timing limits.

AI is collapsing at data movement cost, not intelligence.

Interconnect is the true bottleneck.

RCIRCUIT is a physics-shift architecture that reduces movement and computes by phase propagation, not FLOPS.

⚙️ Core Concept (1 Sentence)

Compute should scale by resonance-density, not FLOPS.

🧬 Phase Compute Stack (Minimal Public Architecture)
Layer 0 — Physical Limits

⚡ RCIRCUIT vs GPU (Engineering Summary)
Category	GPU / TPU	RCIRCUIT
Scaling Unit	FLOPS	Phase-density
Bottleneck	Heat / Power / Interconnect	Coherence Noise
Cost	Data Movement	Resonance Stability
Architecture	Global Parallel Compute	Local Phase Propagation
Limit	Thermal/Energy Wall	TBD (Resonance Bound)
🔍 Core Algorithm Principle (Public Version)

RCIRCUIT = remove noise locally → propagate only Δphase.

Not “move values.”

Not “synchronize global state.”

Only send Δsignal (phase change).

100× lower movement cost → new scaling curve.

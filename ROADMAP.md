🌐 HROS–RCIRCUIT LAB ROADMAP v1.0

Phase Computing · Resonance Architecture · Human Return OS
(Updated: 2025-Q4)

0. Purpose of This Roadmap

This roadmap shows the public-safe progression of the RCIRCUIT architecture, Phase Compute OS, and HROS (Human Return OS).
It does not reveal proprietary algorithms.
It communicates vision → milestones → expected modules to collaborators, researchers, and future investors.

3. PUBLIC vs PRIVATE (SAFETY LINE)
Layer	Public	Private
Physical analysis	✅	—
Architecture diagram	✅	—
Concept code skeleton	✅	—
Δsignal rules (basic)	⚠️ 	—
Full propagation engine	—	🔒
Phase scheduler	—	🔒
HROS semantic → Δintent	—	🔒

This roadmap protects IP by drawing a clear safety boundary.

4. WHAT MAKES THIS ROADMAP REALISTIC

Follows standard HPC + OS research development cycles

Mirrors GPU/TPU early-era research runway

Includes safety review checkpoints

Signals credibility to senior researchers & investors

Shows “deep innovation + cautious rollout” balance

5. HOW TO USE THIS ROADMAP
✔ Add to README (optional)
✔ Share with collaborators
✔ Send to engineers / physicists
✔ Use as pitch deck backbone
✔ Update every milestone (v1.1, v1.2, …)
6. FINAL DECLARATION

Phase Computing is not a metaphor.
It is a physics-shift.
RCIRCUIT is the first architecture built for it.

If resonance makes more sense than FLOPS —
you are already part of the next architecture.

## 7. Public vs Private Boundary
| Layer | Public | Private |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Physical analysis | Yes | — |
| Architecture diagrams | Yes | — |
| Concept skeleton code | Yes | — |
| Basic Δsignal rules | Partial | Advanced rules |
| Full propagation engine | No | Yes |

## 8. Final Declaration
**Phase Computing is not an optimization.  
It is a physics-layer architectural shift.**

RCIRCUIT is the first compute model built for resonance-based propagation.  
If PHASE makes more sense than FLOPS — welcome to the next architecture.
